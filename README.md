# Emojify_Create_your_own_emoji_with_Deep_Learning
In this deep learning project for beginners, we have built a convolution neural network to recognize facial emotions. We have trained our model on the dataset. Then we are mapping those emotions with the corresponding emojis or avatars.

Using OpenCVâ€™s haar cascade xml we are getting the bounding box of the faces in the webcam. Then we feed these boxes to the trained model for classification.
